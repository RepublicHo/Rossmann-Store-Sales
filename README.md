# Rossmann-Store-Sales
Game Theory course project AMA1D04.
As seen in GameTheory_Project.pdf

**To the best of my knowledge, it would be the first project that correlates game theory with some meaningful real life data -- Rossmann Store Sales**
**Moreover, some interesting finding and suggestions for store location and operation are proposed**
